# Project: `wordcount-tool`
> A robust, well-tested, and installable Python package for counting word frequencies in a text file, built following professional software engineering best practices.

This repository documents the main project for the "Advanced Python for Production Systems" module of the AI Infrastructure Engineer Roadmap. The goal was not just to create a simple script, but to engineer a complete software package, starting with a professional project structure, building a robust object-oriented core, and validating its correctness with a comprehensive suite of automated tests.

## Overview

The ability to write code that works is the baseline. [cite_start]The ability to write code that is clean, maintainable, reusable, and reliable is what defines a professional engineer[cite: 70, 71]. This project was an exercise in building software with that professional standard in mind. It transforms a simple task—counting words—into a case study in modern Python development, covering project setup, object-oriented design, advanced language features, and automated testing.

## Core Features
* **Object-Oriented Design:** Core logic is encapsulated in a `WordCounter` class, making it reusable and easy to manage.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Safely handles common errors, such as a non-existent file, without crashing.
* **High Test Coverage:** A full suite of unit tests written with `pytest` ensures the code's reliability, achieving 100% test coverage.
* **Professional Structure:** Organized as a standard, installable Python package with clean separation of application and test code.

## Project Structure
The project was set up using a standard, professional blueprint that separates concerns and enables robust testing and distribution.

## Core Logic & Advanced Concepts
The "engine" of the application was built using a combination of Object-Oriented and functional programming concepts to create clean and efficient code. This included mastering:

* **Classes and Objects (`WordCounter`):** Using a class as a blueprint to create tangible `WordCounter` objects.
* **Encapsulation (`__init__` & `self`):** Using the constructor to initialize each object's state and `self` to maintain that state across methods.
* **Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`):** Implementing these to allow our custom objects to work intuitively with built-in Python functions like `print()` and `len()`.
* **Advanced Concepts:** A deep dive into **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, **Decorators**, **Generators**, and **Context Managers (`with` statement)** to understand the full power of the Python language.

## Robustness and Automated Testing
Writing code that works is only half the battle. A professional engineer must also prove their code is reliable. This was the focus of Segment 3.

### The "Safety Net"
Automated tests are the safety net that catches bugs before they reach production. For this project, we used **`pytest`**, the industry-standard testing framework for Python. `pytest` automatically discovers and runs our tests, providing a clear and immediate report on the health of our codebase.

### Unit Tests
We created a suite of unit tests in the `tests/test_counter.py` file. Each test is a small, focused function designed to verify one specific piece of our application's behavior. The tests cover two key scenarios:
1.  **`test_word_counting`:** This test checks the "happy path." It creates a temporary file with known content and **asserts** that the `WordCounter` class produces the exact word counts we expect.
2.  **`test_file_not_found`:** This test checks the "unhappy path." It ensures that if our `WordCounter` is given a path to a non-existent file, it handles the error gracefully and returns `None` instead of crashing.

### Test Coverage
To ensure our tests were thorough, we measured our **test coverage**. Coverage tells us what percentage of our application code was actually executed during the test run. Using the `pytest-cov` plugin, we achieved **100% test coverage**, meaning every single line of our `counter.py` logic is protected by our automated safety net.

*Instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the tool will be added in the final segment.*
