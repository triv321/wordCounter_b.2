# Segment 2: The Core Logic - Advanced Python in Practice

## Overview

This segment marks a fundamental shift from simple scripting to professional software engineering. The focus was on building the core logic for the `wordcount-tool` by leveraging the power and structure of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and advanced functional concepts in Python.

[cite_start]The goal was not just to write code that works, but to write code that is clean, maintainable, reusable, and efficient—the hallmarks of a production-grade system[cite: 70, 71]. This involved encapsulating the application's logic within a class and mastering a suite of advanced language features.

## Core Concepts Mastered

This segment was divided into two major areas: mastering advanced OOP and applying powerful functional programming concepts.

### 1. Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The core of our application was built using a class-based structure, which provides a logical blueprint for our code.

* **Classes & Objects:** A `WordCounter` class was created to serve as the blueprint. We then learned to instantiate this class to create a tangible `WordCounter` object, a live instance of our tool.

* **Encapsulation (`__init__` & `self`):** The `__init__` constructor was used to initialize each object with its own data (like the file path). The `self` keyword was mastered as the mechanism that allows an object to refer to its own attributes and methods, keeping its state separate from other objects.

* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** We explored how a "child" class can inherit properties and methods from a "parent" class, promoting code reuse. We then learned about polymorphism—the principle that allows different objects to respond to the same method call (e.g., `.drive()`) in their own unique, appropriate ways.

### 2. Advanced Functional Concepts

Beyond OOP, we integrated several of Python's powerful functional features to make our code cleaner and more efficient.

* **Context Managers (`with` statement):** We learned that the `with open(...)` statement is a context manager. This is a critical feature for writing robust code, as it guarantees that resources like files are automatically and safely closed, even if errors occur during processing.

* **Decorators:** Using the "gift wrapper" analogy, we learned how decorators can add extra functionality (like logging or timing) to existing functions without modifying their internal code. This promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

* **Generators (`yield`):** We explored how generators can be used to process huge datasets (like a 100 GB file) in a memory-efficient way. By using `yield`, a function can produce a sequence of values one at a time, without ever needing to load the entire sequence into memory.

## Project Application: The `WordCounter` Class

All of these concepts were applied to the development of the `wordcount_tool/counter.py` module.

```python
# wordcount_tool/counter.py
import re

class WordCounter:
    """A simple class to count words in a text file."""

    def __init__(self, filepath):
        """Initializes the WordCounter with the path to a file."""
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.word_counts = {}

    def count_words(self):
        """Reads, cleans, and counts the words in the file."""
        try:
            with open(self.filepath, 'r') as f:
                text = f.read()
                # Text is cleaned (lowercase, punctuation removed)
                # and processed line by line.
                # ... (logic as implemented) ...
            return self.word_counts
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Error handling for robustness
            return None
